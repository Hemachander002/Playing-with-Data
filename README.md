# Playing-with-Data

### Extracting_Stock_Data.pynb
==> In this notebook, I've used data science libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, yFinance, etc., and I've done some web scraping with the help of the Requests library and BeautifulSoup4.

### Webscraping.pynb
==> In this notebook, you will learn how to import website data into a DataFrame using the BeautifulSoup (BS4) and Requests libraries.

### Webscraping_stocks.pynb
==> Built a compact data workflow to study how business results line up with market behavior. I pulled historical share prices with yfinance, scraped the company’s revenue table using requests and BeautifulSoup, and then cleaned everything in pandas/numpy by standardizing currency, converting values to numeric, normalizing dates, and removing incomplete rows. The output is an interactive two‑panel Plotly view: price on top and revenue over time below. I ran the workflow for Tesla and GameStop to highlight periods where price and fundamentals converge—or pull apart. Next steps: add a trailing 4‑quarter revenue line and simple anomaly checks for sudden jumps.
